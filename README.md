# SteamEscape

Compare Steam game prices across authorized stores and grey market key shops in one place.

Search for any game, click a result, and see a side-by-side comparison of prices from official storefronts (via IsThereAnyDeal) and grey market key sellers (scraped from AllKeyShop) including G2A, Kinguin, Eneba, GAMIVO, and K4G.

## Features

- **Two-step flow** — search games, then click a card to see prices
- **Authorized store prices** — via IsThereAnyDeal API (Steam, Humble, Fanatical, etc.)
- **Grey market scraping** — G2A, Kinguin, Eneba, GAMIVO, K4G prices aggregated from AllKeyShop
- **EUR to USD conversion** — daily exchange rate via Frankfurter API (free, no key required)
- **Dark gaming theme** — clean, responsive web UI
- **Steam exclusivity indicator** — shows "Exclusivo Steam" when no other authorized stores carry the game
